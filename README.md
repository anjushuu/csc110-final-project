## Drought, Wildfires, and Global Warming -
### A Correlation-Based Analysis
This program generates visual graphs utilizing Python libraries and datasets on wildfire, drought, and global temperature statistics to find the correlation between elevated forest fires and the effect of climate change. Made in collaboration with Zaina Azhar and Azka Azmi. For project purposes only; any distribution is strictly prohibited.

### How to Interact with the Program
- Run main.py
- Call the run() function to view the menu. This menu prompts the user to choose an option to display a variety of visual representations of our data. The corresponding visual will be displayed once a choice is made.  
- Call each menu option individually to view the corresponding visual representations:
    - enter run() to see options, enter 1 to see the visual, call the run() function again to see option 2, etc
    - an introduction paragraph can be displayed every time run() is called
